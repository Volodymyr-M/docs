Thanks to Ingantt's tight integration with **Google Drive**, you can use all Google Drive features such as saving files to your cloud, opening them on different devices, and sharing them with others.

## Sign in to Google

If you're not signed in to Google, you can use Ingantt to open or edit local files on your device.

To save your files to your Google Drive, sign in to Google first. When you click the **Sign in with Google** button, a standard Google popup dialog opens.

Ingantt requests the following permissions on Google:

- *See your profile info*: This information is used to identify you as a user.
- *Connect itself to your Google Drive*: This is for the **Web** version only. It allows you to create or open Ingantt files from Google Drive's web user interface (**New** button or **Open with** menu).
- *See, edit, create, and delete only the specific Google Drive files you use with this app*: This permission allows Ingantt to create and edit its own files in your Google Drive but does not allow Ingantt to access your other files.

## Troubleshooting Sign in to Google (Web)

If you don't see the options to create or edit Ingantt files directly from the web interface of Google Drive, re-login and make sure to grant Ingantt the permission to **Connect itself to your Google Drive**.

## Sharing

Using Google Drive's application, you can share your Ingantt file with another person, people, or groups, just like any other file.
