## Select multiple items

On the **Android** version use a long press to select another item. Just hold your finger on the item a little longer than when you tap.

On **Windows** and **Web** versions you can also use the following methods:

- hold *Ctrl* while clicking items with your mouse to select more individual items
- hold *Shift* to select groups of items in-between previously selected and the newly selected item.

This works in all lists (tasks, resources, calendars) and bars representing tasks in the Gantt chart.

## Add and insert items

- If you have an item (task, resource or calendar) selected, clicking on **+** button inserts a new item below the selected one.
- If you have multiple items selected, clicking on **+** button inserts a new button below all of them.
- If no items are selected, clicking on **+** button adds a new item to the end of the list.

## Task Views

There are multiple ways to see tasks in Ingantt. The following task views are available:

- **Split Screen**
- **With Sidebar**
- **Triple View**
- **Gantt Chart Only**
- **List Only**

All these views are fully functional, meaning that you can do every action available for tasks in any view, even when you use **Gantt Chart Only** view. Just use the ability to [select multiple items](#selectUI) anywhere: in the task list or the Gantt chart, as well as the ability to open **Task Properties** by double tapping/clicking (in the list and the chart).
